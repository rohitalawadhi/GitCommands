Origin is the place from where we cloned the repository
Main is the current branch we are working on

Fork is a process to clone a repo locally in your profile of git through UI

Remote: code that is on github
Local: code that is on PC

Rename current branch: git branch -m <new name>

Undoing changes:
if you have added them but not committed:
git reset <file name>
git reset (for all files)

for committed changes:
git reset HEAD~1 // for one commit
git reset <commit hash> // if the changes to be removed are from specific commit
git reset --hard <commit hash> // remove changes from local repo

push:
git push <remote> <branch>

to set upstream for once, so that no need to do git push <remote> <branch>
git push -u <remote> <branch>
then later on we can push just by doing git push, which is similaer to above command

to checkout a new branch :
git checkout -b <new branch>

delete a branch:
git branch -d <branch name>

Throw away local un pushed commits:
git reset --hard origin/master

List all commits between head and origin/master:
git log origin/master..HEAD

To view the diff between commits from head to origin/master:
git diff origin/master..HEAD

Stop git from resolving merge conflict automatically on the basis os previous resolutions:
git config --global rerere.enabled false
Remove global if you need to do only for current repo

Add remote branch name:
git remote add origin <link>
eg: git remote origin https://github.com/rohitalawadhi/GitCommands.git

Diff:
git diff  <branch name> (can be used for commit, branch , files and more)

Merge(2 ways)
1:
git merge <branch name 2> (if you are on branch 1, merge 2 branches, unclear yet)

2:
Create a PR(pull request)


List the remote branch name:
git remote -v
o/p: 
origin	https://github.com/rohitalawadhi/GitCommands.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/rohitalawadhi/GitCommands.git (push)
