Origin is the place from where we cloned the repository
Main is the current branch we are working on

Remote: code that is on github
Local: code that is on PC

Rename current branch: git branch -m <new name>

push:
git push <remote> <branch>

to set upstream for once, so that no need to do git push <remote> <branch>
git push -u <remote> <branch>
then later on we can push just by doing git push, which is similaer to above command

Throw away local un pushed commits:
git reset --hard origin/master

List all commits between head and origin/master:
git log origin/master..HEAD

To view the diff between commits from head to origin/master:
git diff origin/master..HEAD

Stop git from resolving merge conflict automatically on the basis os previous resolutions:
git config --global rerere.enabled false
Remove global if you need to do only for current repo

Add remote branch name:
git remote add origin <link>
eg: git remote origin https://github.com/rohitalawadhi/GitCommands.git


List the remote branch name:
git remote -v
o/p: 
origin	https://github.com/rohitalawadhi/GitCommands.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/rohitalawadhi/GitCommands.git (push)
